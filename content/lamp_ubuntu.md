Summary: Ubuntu LAMP installation.



I was fighting with my linux box for 2 days because I couldn't het my LAMP server 
installed and correctly configured on my machine hats off to Mr. Shuttleworth, they have a fine utility called
`tasksel` for feisty and gutsy that installed it quite easily.

you have to push spacebar to select option it have lots of other server like dns mail etc. 
just fire tasksel on ur root shell(or as a sudo user) or if u just want to have LAMP then
`type sudo tasksel install lamp-server`.
