Summary: Better Programmer tips by hanselman


this is sort of like a maintenance entry, to remind myself that I did this,
it is referenced from [following blog post](http://secretgeek.net/6min_program), nice points

1. **Make IDEs font bigger**
    
    suggested by Mr.Hanselman, the same guy as hanselminutes, the author go from 10 to 14,
    mine is 12 by default so , I guess I am on 16, the aim is to have less weird functions, This seems to look great , let me see the effect on my productivity.
        
2. **Make hard coded strings look ugly**
    
    I don't really understand it but, what the hell, lets do it, yeah this surely is more effective than it sounds.

3. **lets just forget about the 3rd one**

4. **Unit test**

    I don't do unit tests(I am a undergrad not in any kinda production environment) so skip it also - in hindsight, it looks like I should have started it earlier.

5. **Read the code from an open source project**
    
    this surely helped me , even if I don't understand most of it, but still fun to see a nice project under the hood

6. **over my head**

7. **same as 6**

8. **Stop reading, start writing**
    
    yeah I am doing it right now , and surely it is time-tested but much ignored tip.
