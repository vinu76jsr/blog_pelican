Summary: Linux Desktop with Conky


Recently I came across 2 wonderful apps in the linux system Conky and Avant window navigator, 
and as per the general consensus, Ubuntu is by far not the best looking distribution in linux, 
but that was all fine with me , I always gave priority to performance and most of the time my Compiz 
is turned off, today I came across this video by softpedia where they made their desktop christmasy , 
and I was sold , the amount of effort that guy put was negligible as compared to the awesomeness of UI, 
I decided to give a simple overhaul to my system by just include Avant and Conky and the result 
is my desktop turned from human theme to this screen-shot.

here we have two Conky running along with Avant window navigator.
