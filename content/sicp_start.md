Yesterday I started(or restarted in some sense) the acclaimed text
of *SICP* base on recommendation of one of friends, 
I thought of it to be a dense boring textbook which teaches 
programming in an awkward manner and you have to hold your 
breath to get through it, I remembered picking it up few 
years ago in college and just browsing through it , 
I had read some text and my observation was whatever 
I mentioned above, but now with a fresh perspective 
and some maturity(:))I thought of giving it a second try, 
ordered the book and received it within a day, and boy was I wrong
, This book is definitely a masterpiece, perhaps I lacked the brain capacity
to fully appreciate it before so now I decided to go through it over a period of time 
and completely finish it withing few months including the exercise, the book
is terse mind you and requires a fair level of dedication to get through 
if you don't have time to finish it
