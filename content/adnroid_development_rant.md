Summary: Android developer rant.



Android is a great platform and with an awesome marketplace it's a developer's dream OS, here are some of the points I
would like to emphasize which can greatly improve developer's life

DISCLAIMER : all opinions are mine and since I am not employed by anyone, this disclaimer is a waste of space


1. **Developer's can't sell**

    By far Android is available in lots of countries and is open for developers but for some people like me
    who are from lesser part of this world , we are not getting as much google's love,
    or shall I say Android's love, I am from India, and apparently I can buy app from android market ,
    but cannot sell , which is a major blow-back, this seems to be more of &nbsp;a strategic decision
    from google's side to push the checkout system , but I should iterate that I wouldn't mind paying paypal
    some of my earnings but at least have that option for some of us.

2. **Fragmentation**

    I (so far) developed apps which are useful in nature (no games , no entertainment apps) not because
    I have something against them , it's just they are hard to think of and there are plenty of it in the market,
    so for me fragmentation is non-existent, just use standard controls and your app will be good for any screen.

3. **Too much hype**

    Android is great but not that much great if you look into alternative, windows phone 7 has far better UI,
    and developing for WebOS is a breeze and really refreshing, the only thing this hype created is almost unlimited
    number of apps, although all are not good in quality but numbers do help journalist.<br />

4. **Too much open**

    Google made android open source which is a good thing , I must say a very good thing,
    but some companies are using it against it, there are really basic hardware running android
    and vendors lock it on year old versions, &nbsp;I for once have a Optimus One and only reason
    I got it was because it was the only Froyo phone available in the market, and btw it doesn't support flash.

***Now some good points about android.***

1. **Great for Java developers**

    I learned Java as my first language (BASIC was too limited and C++ was plain ugly),
    and android provides a proper platform to implement that knowledge, APIs are very easy to pick up,
    I had some experience in J2ME and frankly I must say, it's a mess.

2. **low level of entry**

    $25 for lifetime unlimited apps is great for someone starting to develop for a platform,
    in perspective, windows phone 7 charges $100/yr to publish 10 free apps and unlimited paid apps(weird limit),
    in android this limit doesn't exist, WebOS doesn't charge anything,
    RIM to doesn't charge anything for first 10 apps, but their submission process
    is fairly non-intuitive and as for iOS you have to own a Mac just get started.

3. **open market**

    Android market is by far the most open , it takes an instant to update your app,
    just a push of button, after it I think webOS app submission comes with turnaround time of 24-48 hours.

everything else aside, if they let me sell apps , I would just get my act up and wash-off the first 4 points.
