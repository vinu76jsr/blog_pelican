Summary: dhoom 3 movie review

Today I went on to see Dhoom 3 after a previous arrangement was
 cancelled and I had
a lot of unplanned time, for the uninitiated Dhoom 3
is part of a very successful movie
franchise and as the title suggest, it's the 3rd part of
 the same, the story didn't tie up
to the previous movie except lead good guys are the same
and are cops, the movie had very funky gadgets, particularly Amir's
character during the course of the movie and mostly to do with his Bike,

Katrina was as usual there just for the dance numbers however her
acting has improved a lot in the recent couple of years, the dance numbers
had a catchy tune so music was not a downer in any regard and if you set your expectation
low enough you might be able to enjoy the action sequences
, true they were far-fetched but acted well enough that
if you engross yourself in the acting especially Mr.Khan's then maybe you would be able
to shed a tear or two, I myself did it when they showed the back-story,
the plot has a few weak points like the blame they put on the bank for the
death of Jackie's character which was unrealistic to say the least,
and if you have seen prestige then you will see some plot twists coming from a mile away,


The ending was succinct and out of character for a bollywood movie when you
have a possibility of Happy ending wide open, and showed a hint of Amir khan's
influence there. overall the movie was enjoyable.
