Summary: Hysterical Raisins is a pun for Historical Reasons.

Recently I came across this weird phrase `Hysterical Raisins` while looking for
redmine git plugin which supports mailmap, which led me to following link [Nabble mailmap](http://git.661346.n2.nabble.com/git-log-to-use-mailmap-by-default-td7570862.html), apparently it's a pun for historical reasons and is for code which is present for backwards compatibility, but why such a weird pun, it is something which passes for programmer's humor.
