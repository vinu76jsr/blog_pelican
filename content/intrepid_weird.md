Summary: Ubuntu upside down bug.


When i select normal settings in `system > preference > appearance > visual effects` from none, my system GUI
turn upside down, It's not a 180 degree rotation but a mirror reflection ,observe the two screens , i don't know what 
to do except reporting this bug

but *apport* seems to not submit any kind of report so I filed the report to launchpad, 
I have no problem with this bug because changing settings to none recovers from it but , 
what if someone want to use compiz, this is reported as bug `#267269` in launchpad.
