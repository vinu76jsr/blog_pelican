Summary: Dion Office Trip

Yesterday, I came back from a 2 day office trip to Khashid
 Beach in Alibaug, it was meant to be a get together of our
otherwise disparate team, we left Thursday morning via
bus to Kashid Beach although with a delay of about 1 hour,
according to official itinerary, the schedule time for departure
 was 9:00 AM but in the wise words of our Game-Master Rahul
 _Rules are meant to be broken_, a delay should not be considered
 in normal context a breakage of rule but
just a minor inconvenience and not necessarily a bad thing.

The journey was via bus and took around 4 hours,
to keep us entertained for the journey,
Rahul worked effortlessly
devise some original games including __Guess the tag-line__ and
__Dumb Charade__, after reaching there 2 hours late; everybody
immediately changed to more comfortable clothing and moved for
 lunch, our stay was at a place called [Prakruti Resort](https://plus.google.com/104253697724630149974/about?hl=en)
which was supposed to have a private beach but did not had one,
 however it had a big plot across the road near the beach
just 10min walking distance from the actual location but
in the words of most of engineers and maybe captain Spock,
We as engineer embrace technicality, nonetheless the stay
was great the resort was beautiful to say the least, it had
few gimmicks (Bullock cart ride to beach, props by some
Maharaja which you are not allowed to touch), but I suppose that
goes with the territory.

Whole day was packed with games and rules presided
over by Rahul who suddenly acquired impeccable ethics and didn't gave
any leeway to our team, the day was spent on the
_private beach_ of the resort and near the pool, at night we had a
bonfire which was accompanied by _guess who is who_
for the new members of the team, at around 1:00 AM people started dropping
left and right, next morning we had a checkout schedule
at around 11 AM so everybody woke up, had breakfast and loaded into the
bus, everybody was tired and people started
dozing off(at least I did) when the bus left for Mumbai,
that was the conclusion of our little excursion
and I believe it served it's purpose fairly well.
